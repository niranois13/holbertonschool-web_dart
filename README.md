# Holberton Web Dart

This repository contains all projects of ![Holberton](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)'s curicullum about ![Dart](https://dart.dev/)

**Dart** is an object-oriented programming language developed by _Google_. It's designed for building fast, scalable, and high-performance **applications** across multiple platforms—primarily _web_, _mobile_, and _desktop_.

**Dart** is best known as the language behind **![Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)**, _Google_'s popular UI toolkit for building natively compiled apps from a single codebase.

With its _clean syntax_, _strong typing_, and support for _asynchronous programming_ via `async/await`, **Dart** makes it easy for developers to write efficient and responsive applications.

One of **Dart**’s key strengths is its versatility: it compiles both _ahead-of-time_ (AOT) for performance on mobile devices and _just-in-time_ (JIT) for fast development cycles.
